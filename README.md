## Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* Django web framework (uses Python)

Spellement is my first web application, and I created this project to learn more about web development. 
I chose this project because I've often found myself staring at the periodic table poster in lecture, 
spelling words in my head using the chemical symbols. I also love science, so this was a good way to combine my interests.

The elements and their corresponding information are not hard-coded into the programâ€”
they are stored in a database and can be manipulated through the Django admin website. 

Words that cannot be spelled solely using element symbols are constructed using [fictional elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_elements,_materials,_isotopes_and_subatomic_particles) from popular novels and films.
