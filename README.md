* Django web framework (uses Python)

Spellement is my first web application, and I created this project to learn more about web development. 
I've often found myself staring at the periodic table poster in my lecture hall, 
spelling words in my head using the chemical symbols. So I thought: why not make the computer do that for me? I also love science, so Spellement was a way to combine my interests.

The elements and their corresponding information are not hard-coded into the programâ€”
they are stored in a database and can be manipulated through the Django admin website. 

Words that cannot be spelled solely using element symbols are constructed using [fictional elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_elements,_materials,_isotopes_and_subatomic_particles) from popular novels and films.
